# Big Data Challenge 2013

Thanks for participating in the challenge. We've had a great response and I'm excited to see what you all can come up with.

General information about the global challenge is up on the [Big Data Week site](http://bigdataweek.com/bigdatachallenge/).

## Logistics

The hackathon will run from noon on Saturday to 8PM on Sunday, though teams are free to come and go (and work remotely) as they see fit. Note that access to the Biltmore is restricted, so if you intend to use Hypepotamus as a workspace overnight, you will need to call someone inside to be let in.

We'll be providing pizza, snacks and refreshments throughout the event.

### Teams

You are free to manage your team however you see fit, but I'd encourage each team to start a repo under the atl-bigdataweek organization and share their results. Team captains should see me about getting admin access to manage their team. Note that competitive teams should consist of no more than 5 people.

### Competition

Entries for the global competition must be submitted by 15:00 GMT / 10:00 AM local time. See the [submission details](http://bigdataweek.com/bigdatachallenge/).

The Atlanta local competition will be open until 8PM, so teams can continue to polish their work and compete for $PRIZES. Judging critera for both competitions will be the same.

This is the data set provided by the organizers of the global Big Data Challenge. It contains comprehensive statistics about a range of public health concerns, including medical, fire, police, school, and traffic records. I'd encourage you to connect and poke around the table schema to see what all is available.
